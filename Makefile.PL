************************************************************************
You are building PadWalker in debugging mode, which causes it to
print a lot of gnomic information about its internal operation.
The test suite will fail, because this information will confuse
the test harness. You almost certainly do *not* want to do this
unless you're the author of PadWalker (or perhaps just irrepressibly
curious about its internal operation).
